# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In this project I was "challenged" to create a simple nutritionist website, which was eye-catching and used the same standard images as the client's clinic.

This project used some of my (few) skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and ReactJS.
